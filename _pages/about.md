Hi there! I'm Amir, a computer science guy with a passion for understanding how the brain works. I geek out over things like neural networks, brain-computer interfaces, and decoding neural data.

This past summer, I interned at the Brain Computing Lab of the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM). I worked with single-unit and multi-unit recordings from monkeys performing a visual working memory task. My analyses focused on replicating findings related to phase-locking of inferotemporal cortex spikes predicting successful memory maintenance.

In 2022, I interned at IPM's HPC Center studying spiking neural networks. I explored hybrid neural network architectures and reasoning networks. I gained hands-on SNN development experience with snntorch.

When I'm not immersed in research or coding, I enjoy listening to dream pop, writing poetry and playing basketball. This website serves as a platform to share my projects and research. Feel free to explore, and let's connect!
