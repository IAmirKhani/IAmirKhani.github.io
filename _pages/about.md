Hello! I'm Mohammadamir, a passionate computer scientist with a keen interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. Currently in the final year of my Bachelor's program at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Iran, I've dedicated my academic journey to exploring the depths of neural data analysis and its applications.

Beyond the classroom, I've been fortunate to intern at the Brain Computing Lab at the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences. Here, I worked extensively with spike and local field potential recordings from non-human primates, gaining hands-on experience that has shaped my perspective on neural data analysis.

I've also been an active participant in the Neuromatch Academy, an online summer course, for two consecutive years. My work here, especially with the Neuropixels dataset in mice's brain, has been a testament to my commitment to the field.

When I'm not immersed in research or coding, I enjoy listening to dream pop music, watching movies and playing basketball. This website serves as a platform to share my projects and research. Feel free to explore, and let's connect!
